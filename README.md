# About Me

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ I am an experienced engineer working at the intersection of traditional data engineering and data platform. 

I am passionate about architecting and building modern datalakes and lakehouse platforms with open table formats like [Iceberg](https://github.com/apache/iceberg), local query engines like [DuckDB](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb), modern orchestration tools like [Dagster](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster), open-catalogs like [Unity Catalog](https://github.com/unitycatalog/unitycatalog), warehouse modelling tools like [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core), and infrastructure frameworks like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

Reach out if you are a series A-D startup, looking to build a scalable, cheap and resilient data platform to support your analytics and AI functions. 

The future of the data platfrom is open-source: bring your own compute.
